## ðŸ“š What I Learned

While working on this challenge, I practiced:

- Loading local fonts with `@font-face`
- Creating responsive card components
- Using `object-fit` for image scaling
- Applying hover effects for better interactivity

```css
.container .card-title:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

## ðŸ“Œ Continued Development

I want to keep improving by:

- Making designs more fluid instead of fixed heights
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for card layouts
- Enhancing accessibility with ARIA labels
